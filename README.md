## What is DB-GPT?

As large models are released and iterated upon, they are becoming increasingly intelligent. However, in the process of using large models, we face significant challenges in data security and privacy. We need to ensure that our sensitive data and environments remain completely controlled and avoid any data privacy leaks or security risks. Based on this, we have launched the DB-GPT project to build a complete private large model solution for all database-based scenarios. This solution supports local deployment, allowing it to be applied not only in independent private environments but also to be independently deployed and isolated according to business modules, ensuring that the ability of large models is absolutely private, secure, and controllable.

DB-GPT is an experimental open-source project that uses localized GPT large models to interact with your data and environment. With this solution, you can be assured that there is no risk of data leakage, and your data is 100% private and secure.

## Features

Currently, we have released multiple key features, which are listed below to demonstrate our current capabilities:

- SQL language capabilities
  - SQL generation
  - SQL diagnosis
- Private domain Q&A and data processing
  -   Knowledge Management(We currently support many document formats: txt, pdf, md, html, doc, ppt, and url.)
  -  Database knowledge Q&A
  - knowledge Embedding
- Plugins
  -  Support custom plugin execution tasks and natively support the Auto-GPT plugin, such as:
    - Automatic execution of SQL and retrieval of query results
    - Automatic crawling and learning of knowledge
- Unified vector storage/indexing of knowledge base
  - Support for unstructured data such as PDF, TXT, Markdown, CSV, DOC, PPT, and WebURL

- Multi LLMs Support
  - Supports multiple large language models, currently supporting Vicuna (7b, 13b), ChatGLM-6b (int4, int8), guanaco(7b,13b,33b), Gorilla(7b,13b)
  - TODO: codegen2, codet5p


## Introduction 
DB-GPT creates a vast model operating system using [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and offers a large language model powered by [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/Tribbiani/vicuna-7b). In addition, we provide private domain knowledge base question-answering capability. Furthermore, we also provide support for additional plugins, and our design natively supports the Auto-GPT plugin.Our vision is to make it easier and more convenient to build  applications around databases and llm.



Is the architecture of the entire DB-GPT shown in the following figure:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/DB-GPT.png" width="800" />
</p>

The core capabilities mainly consist of the following parts:
1. Knowledge base capability: Supports private domain knowledge base question-answering capability.
2. Large-scale model management capability: Provides a large model operating environment based on FastChat.
3. Unified data vector storage and indexing: Provides a uniform way to store and index various data types.
4. Connection module: Used to connect different modules and data sources to achieve data flow and interaction.
5. Agent and plugins: Provides Agent and plugin mechanisms, allowing users to customize and enhance the system's behavior.
6. Prompt generation and optimization: Automatically generates high-quality prompts and optimizes them to improve system response efficiency.
7. Multi-platform product interface: Supports various client products, such as web, mobile applications, and desktop applications.



## Install 
[Quickstart](https://db-gpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)

## Usage Instructions

- [Multi LLMs Usage](https://db-gpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/llms.html)
- [Create your own knowledge repository](https://db-gpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/knowledge.html)

If nltk-related errors occur during the use of the knowledge base, you need to install the nltk toolkit. For more details, please refer to: [nltk documents](https://www.nltk.org/data.html)
Run the Python interpreter and type the commands:

```bash
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```
