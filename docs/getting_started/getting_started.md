# Quickstart Guide

#### Welcome to DB-GPT!

DB-GPT is an experimental open-source project that uses localized GPT large models to interact with your data and
environment. With this solution, you can be assured that there is no risk of data leakage, and your data is 100% private
and secure.

Our vision is to make it easier and more convenient to build applications around databases and llm.
