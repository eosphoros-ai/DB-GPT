# Prompts

Prompt is a very important part of the interaction between the large model and the user, and to a certain extent, it determines the quality and accuracy of the answer generated by the large model. In this project, we will automatically optimize the corresponding prompt according to user input and usage scenarios, making it easier and more efficient for users to use large language models.
