# Vector storage and indexing

In order to facilitate the management of knowledge after vectorization, we have built-in multiple vector storage engines, from memory-based Chroma to distributed Milvus. Users can choose different storage engines according to their own scenario needs. The storage of knowledge vectors is the cornerstone of AI capability enhancement. As the intermediate language for interaction between humans and large language models, vectors play a very important role in this project.
