# Graph RAG


In this example, we will show how to use the Graph RAG framework in DB-GPT. Using a graph database to implement RAG can, to some extent, alleviate the uncertainty and interpretability issues brought about by vector database retrieval.

You can refer to the python example file `DB-GPT/examples/rag/graph_rag_example.py` in the source code. This example demonstrates how to load knowledge from a document and store it in a graph store. Subsequently, it recalls knowledge relevant to your question by searching for triplets in the graph store.


### Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the `dbgpt graph_rag` library.

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --frozen \
--extra "base" \
--extra "proxy_openai" \
--extra "rag" \
--extra "storage_chromadb" \
--extra "dbgpts" \
--extra "graph_rag"
````

### Prepare Graph Database

To store the knowledge in graph, we need an graph database, [TuGraph](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-db) is the first graph database supported by DB-GPT.

Visit github repository of TuGraph to view [Quick Start](https://tugraph-db.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/3.quick-start/1.preparation.html#id5) document, follow the instructions to pull the TuGraph database docker image (latest / version >= 4.5.1) and launch it.

```
docker pull tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:4.5.1
docker run -d -p 7070:7070  -p 7687:7687 -p 9090:9090 --name tugraph_demo tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:latest lgraph_server -d run --enable_plugin true
```

The default port for the bolt protocol is `7687`.

> **Download Tips:**
> 
> There is also a corresponding version of the TuGraph Docker image package on OSS. You can also directly download and import it.
> 
> ```
> wget 'https://tugraph-web.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/tugraph/tugraph-4.5.1/tugraph-runtime-centos7-4.5.1.tar' -O tugraph-runtime-centos7-4.5.1.tar
> docker load -i tugraph-runtime-centos7-4.5.1.tar
> ```



### TuGraph Configuration

Set variables below in `configs/dbgpt-graphrag.toml` file, let DB-GPT know how to connect to TuGraph.

```
[rag.storage.graph]
type = "TuGraph"
host="127.0.0.1"
port=7687
username="admin"
password="73@TuGraph"
enable_summary="True"
enable_similarity_search="True"
```

Then run the following command to start the webserver:
```bash
uv run python packages/dbgpt-app/src/dbgpt_app/dbgpt_server.py --config configs/dbgpt-graphrag.toml
```

Optionally, you can also use the following command to start the webserver:
uv run python packages/dbgpt-app/src/dbgpt_app/dbgpt_server.py --config configs/dbgpt-proxy-openai.toml
