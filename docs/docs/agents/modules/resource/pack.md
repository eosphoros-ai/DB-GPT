# Resource Pack

The resource pack is a collection of resources that can be used by agents. It usually 
contains some tools, databases, knowledge bases, etc.

In previous sections [tools#wrap-your-tools-to-toolpack](../../introduction/tools#wrap-your-tools-to-toolpack),
we have introduced how to wrap optional tools into `ToolPack`, so you can refer to it for more details.
