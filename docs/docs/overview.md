# Overview
DB-GPT is an **open-source framework for large language models(LLMs) in the databases fields**. It's purpose is to build infrastructure for the domain of large language models, making it easier and more convenient to develop applications around databases by developing various technical capabilities such as:

-  **SMMF(Service-oriented Multi-model Management Framework)**
-  **Text2SQL Fine-tuning**
-  **RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) Framework and Optimization**
-  **Data-Driven Agents Framework Collaboration**

In the Data 3.0 era, enterprises/developers can build their own exclusive applications with less code based on LLMs and databases.

## Features

##### Private Domain Q&A & Data Processing & RAG
- Supports custom construction of knowledge bases through methods such as built-in, multi-file format uploads, and plugin-based web scraping. Enables unified vector storage and retrieval of massive structured and unstructured data.

##### Multi-Data Source & GBI(Generative Business Intelligence)
- Supports interaction between natural language and various data sources such as Excel, databases, and data warehouses. Also supports analysis reporting. 

##### SMMF(Service-oriented Multi-model Management Framework)
- Supports a wide range of models, including dozens of large language models such as open-source models and API proxies. Examples include LLaMA/LLaMA2, Baichuan, ChatGLM, ERNIE Bot, Qwen, Spark, etc.

##### Automated Fine-tuning
- Supports Text2SQL fine-tuning. Provides a lightweight automatic fine-tuning framework around the fields of LLM and Text2SQL, supporting methods such as LoRA/QLoRA/P-turning, making Text2SQL fine-tuning as convenient as a production line.
##### Data-Driven Multi-Agents & Plugins
- Supports executing tasks through custom plugins and natively supports the Auto-GPT plugin model. [Agents protocol](https://agentprotocol.ai/) follows the Agent Protocol standard.

##### Privacy and Security
- Supports data privacy protection. Ensures data privacy and security through techniques such as privatizing large language models and proxy de-identification.
