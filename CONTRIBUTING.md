# Contribution 

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to this project. 
It's people like you that make it a reality for the community. There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them.

This guide will help you get started with contributing to this project.

## Fork The Repository

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to by clicking the "Fork" button on the project page.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/DB-GPT
```
Please replace `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` with your GitHub username.


## Create A New Development Environment

1. Create a new virtual environment using the following command:
```
# Make sure python >= 3.10
conda create -n dbgpt_env python=3.10
conda activate dbgpt_env
```

2. Change to the project directory using the following command:
```
cd DB-GPT
```

3. Install the project from the local source using the following command:
```
# it will take some minutes
pip install -e ".[default]"
```

4. Install development requirements
```
pip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements/lint-requirements.txt
```

5. Install pre-commit hooks
```
pre-commit install
```

6. Install `make` command
The `make` command has been installed by default on most Unix-based systems. If you not 
have it, you can install it by searching on the internet.

## New Branch And Make Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes using the following command:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
Please replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch.

2. Make your changes to the code or documentation.

3. Add tests for your changes if necessary.

4. Format your code using the following command:
```
make fmt
```

5. Run the tests using the following command:
```
make test
```

6. Check types using the following command:
```
make mypy
```

7. Check lint using the following command:
```
make fmt-check
```

8. If all checks pass, you can add and commit your changes using the following commands:
```
git add xxxx
```
make sure to replace `xxxx` with the files you want to commit.

then commit your changes using the following command:
```
git commit -m "your commit message"
```
Please replace `your commit message` with a meaningful commit message.

It will take some time to get used to the process, but it's worth it. And it will run 
all git hooks and checks before you commit. If it fails, you need to fix the issues 
then re-commit it.

9. Push the changes to your forked repository using the following command:
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Create A Pull Request

1. Go to the GitHub website and navigate to your forked repository.

2. Click the "New pull request" button.

3. Select the branch you just pushed to and the branch you want to merge into on the original repository.
Write necessary information about your changes and click "Create pull request".

4. Wait for the project maintainer to review your changes and provide feedback.

That's it you made it üê£‚≠ê‚≠ê
