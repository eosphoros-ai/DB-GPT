"""Run your code assistant agent in a sandbox environment.

This example demonstrates how to create a code assistant agent that can execute code
in a sandbox environment. The agent can execute Python and JavaScript code blocks
and provide the output to the user. The agent can also check the correctness of the
code execution results and provide feedback to the user.


You can limit the memory and file system resources available to the code execution
environment. The code execution environment is isolated from the host system,
preventing access to the internet and other external resources.
