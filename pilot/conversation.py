#             "but PostgreSQL is generally considered to be more strict in enforcing it.\n"
#             "3. Replication: MySQL has a built-in replication feature, which allows you to replicate data across multiple servers,"
#             "whereas PostgreSQL has a similar feature, but it is not as mature as MySQL's.\n"
#             "4. Performance: MySQL is generally considered to be faster and more efficient in handling large datasets, "
